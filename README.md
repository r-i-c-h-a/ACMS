Currently each seller who wish to sell his/her product on e-commerce websites has to register himself at all e-commerce websites separately. These are the pain points they face:

- To keep tracking of new e commerce websites coming into the market and registering himself again.
- To change any details like sellerâ€™s address/contact no, new store launch or anything with the e-commerce sites, he has to do it repeatedly on all websites.
- Keep track of so many accounts and their own requirements/expectations from seller.

Here with this project, we are aiming to create a centrally managed seller portal where a seller needs to register himself with all his details and his product details and all e-commerce websites will contact this portal to get seller details and their product details. Sites can grant their own discount (or charge more) over and above what seller is offering.
